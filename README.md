Want to know this page was coded and done?

I'm excited to share with you the dental clinic webpage that I recently created. I started the design process by using Figma, and my mentor was incredibly helpful in guiding me through the process. We worked together to create a design that was modern, professional, and user-friendly.

Once the design was finalized, I began working on the HTML code. I made sure to organize the code in a clear and concise manner, using appropriate tags and attributes to ensure that the page was accessible and responsive.

After the HTML was complete, I moved on to the CSS portion of the project. I used CSS to add style and formatting to the page, including fonts, colors, and layout. I also used CSS to make sure that the page looked great on a variety of different devices and screen sizes.

Finally, I added JavaScript functionality to the page. I used JavaScript to create interactive features, such as a dropdown navigation menu and a form for scheduling appointments.

Overall, I am thrilled with the final result of the dental clinic webpage. I believe that it effectively communicates the clinic's services and values, while also providing an enjoyable and informative experience for visitors. Thank you for taking the time to check it out!

Thank you!
